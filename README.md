<h1>FOR USE IN MY GOOGLE SITE AT MY SCHOOL FOR PLAYING MINECRAFT</h1>
Yes I am another student making stuff on a google site for other people
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h1>HOW THIS WORKS</h1>
My Google site gets the code from raw.githubusercontent.com/ZikestrikeWasTaken/Resent-client-Google-site/refs/heads/main/Resent.html <br>
Then lets you open it in a new tab
<br>
<small>To be honest I had chatgpt make the code for my Google Site since I had no time to learn html since I needed this today</small>
