<h1>FOR USE IN MY GOOGLE SITE AT MY SCHOOL FOR PLAYING MINECRAFT</h1>
<br>
<h1>HOW THIS WORKS</h1>
My Google site gets the code from raw.githubusercontent.com/ZikestrikeWasTaken/Resent-client-Google-site/refs/heads/main/Resent.html <br>
Then lets you open it in a new tab
<br>
The code to it is in Main.html
